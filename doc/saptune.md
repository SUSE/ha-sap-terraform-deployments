You can tune your hana or netweaver nodes with saptune during the deployment phase.

1) Apply a saptune solution during deployment:

In order to apply a saptune solution, you need to adapt the pillars:

```

```

By default the pillars are configured to apply HANA for hana nodes and NETWEAVER solution for netweavers.
