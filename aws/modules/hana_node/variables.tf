    This map describes how the disks will be formatted to create the definitive configuration during the provisioning.

    disks_type and disks_size are used during the disks creation. The number of elements must match in all of them
    "," is used to separate each disk.

    disk_type = The disk type used to create disks. See https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/volume-types/ and https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ebs_volume for reference.
    disk_size = The disk size in GB.

    luns, names, lv_sizes and paths are used during the provisioning to create/format/mount logical volumes and filesystems.
    "#" character is used to split the volume groups, while "," is used to define the logical volumes for each group
    The number of groups split by "#" must match in all of the entries.

    luns  -> The luns or disks used for each volume group. The number of luns must match with the configured in the previous disks variables (example 0,1#2,3#4#5#6)
    names -> The names of the volume groups and logical volumes (example data#log#shared#usrsap#backup)
    lv_sizes -> The size in % (from available space) dedicated for each logical volume and folder (example 50#50#100#100#100)
    paths -> Folder where each volume group will be mounted (example /hana/data,/hana/log#/hana/shared#/usr/sap#/hana/backup#/sapmnt/)
