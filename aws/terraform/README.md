## AWS Public Cloud deployment with terraform

The terraform configuration files in this directory can be used to create the infrastructure required to perform the installation of a SAP HanaSR cluster with Suse Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications in *AWS*.

The infrastructure deployed includes:

- A Virtual Private Cloud
- A local subnet within the VPC
- A security group with rules for access to the instances created in the subnet. Only allowed external network traffic is for the protocols: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and for the HAWK service. Internally to the subnet, all traffic is allowed.
- An Internet gateway
- A route table with its corresponding associations.
- EC2 instances.

By default, this configuration will create 3 instances in AWS: one for support services (mainly iSCSI as most other services - DHCP, NTP, etc - are provided by Amazon) and 2 cluster nodes, but this can be changed to deploy more cluster nodes as needed.

## Relevant files

These are the relevant files and what each provides:

- [provider.tf](provider.tf): definition of the providers being used in the terraform configuration. Mainly `aws` and `template`.

- [variables.tf](variables.tf): definition of variables used in the configuration. These include definition of the AMIs in use, number and type of instances, AWS region, etc.

- [keys.tf](keys.tf): definition of key to include in the instances to allow connection via SSH.

- [network.tf](network.tf): definition of network resources (VPC, route table, Internet Gateway and security group) used by the infrastructure.

- [instances.tf](instances.tf): definition of the EC2 instances to create on deployment.

- [templates.tf](templates.tf): definition of templates to use in the `user_data` field of the EC2 instances.

- [init-iscsi.tpl](init-iscsi.tpl): template code for the initialization script for the iSCSI server. This will partition the second device and set up the iSCSI targets.

- [init-nodes.tpl](init-nodes.tpl): template code for the initialization script for the cluster nodes. This will connect the cluster nodes to the iSCSI server, configure a wathdog for the cluster, issue a call to `ha-cluster-init` in the master and a call to `ha-cluster-join` in the slaves.

- [outputs.tf](outputs.tf): definition of outputs of the terraform configuration.

- [remote-state.tf](remote-state.tf): definition of the backend to [store the Terraform state file remotely](create_remote_state).

- [terraform.tfvars](terraform.tfvars): file containing initialization values for variables used thoughout the configuration. **Edit this file with your values before use**.

## How to use

To use, copy the files `*.tf`, `*.tpl` and `terraform.tfvars` into a directory, and then run from the directory the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Important**: when not using remote terraform states, the `terraform init` command will fail unless the file [remote-states.tf](remote-states.tf) is removed before initialization. When using remote terraform states, first follow the [procedure to create a remote terraform state](create_remote_state).

This configuration uses the public **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12-SP3 BYOS x86_64** image available in AWS (as defined in the file [variables.tf](variables.tf)) and can be used as is.

If the use of a private image is required (for example, to perform the Build Validation of a new AWS Public Cloud image), first upload the image to the cloud using the [procedure described below](#upload-image-to-aws), and then [register it as an AMI](#import-ami-via-snapshot). Once the new AMI is available, edit the following terraform files:

* [terraform.tfvars](terraform.tfvars): the public SSH key to use to connect to the instances.
* [variables.tf](variables.tf): the AMI id to use in the Build Validation (the one uploaded, imported and registered in the above steps)

And run the commands:

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

After an `apply` command, terraform will deploy the insfrastructure to the cloud and ouput the public IP addresses and names of the iSCSI server and the cluster nodes. Connect using `ssh` as the user `ec2-user`, for example:

```
ssh ec2-user@18.196.143.128
```

Destroy the created infrastructure with:

```
terraform destroy
```

Check outputs with:

```
terraform output
```

By default this configuration will deploy the infrastructure to the `eu-central-1` region of AWS. Internally, the provided terraform files are only configured for the European (eu-central-1, eu-west-1, eu-west-2 and eu-west-3) and North American zones (us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2 and ca-central-1), but this as well as the default zone can be changed by editing the [variables.tf](variables.tf) or the [terraform.tfvars](terraform.tfvars) files.

It is also possible to change the AWS region from the command line with the `-var aws_region` parameter, for example:

```
terraform apply -var aws_region=eu-central-1
```

Will deploy the insfrastructure in Frankfurt.

The EC2 instances for the cluster nodes are created by default with the type `m4.2xlarge`, this can be changed with the option `-var instancetype`. For example:

```
terraform apply -var aws_region=eu-central-1 -var instancetype=m4.large
```

Will deploy 2 `m4.large` instances in Frankfurt, instead of the `m4.2xlarge` default ones. The iSCSI server is always deployed with the `t2.micro` type instance.

Finally, the number of cluster nodes can be modified with the option `-var ninstances`. For example:

```
terraform apply -var aws_region=eu-central-1 -var ninstances=4
```

Will deploy in Frankfurt 1 `t2.micro` instance as an iSCSI server, and 4 `m4.2xlarge` instances as cluster nodes.

All this means that basically the default command `terraform apply` and be also written as `terraform apply -var instancetype=m4.2xlarge -var ninstances=2`.

### Variables

In the file [terraform.tfvars](terraform.tfvars) there are a number of variables that control what is deployed. Some of these variables are:

* **instancetype**: instance type to use for the cluster nodes; basically the "size" (number of vCPUS and memory) of the instance. Defaults to `t2.micro`.
* **ninstances**: number of cluster nodes to deploy. Defaults to 2.
* **aws_region**: AWS region where to deploy the configuration.
* **public_key**: SSH public key associated with the private key file. This public key is configured in the file $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys of the administration user in the remote virtual machines.
* **private_key_location**: local path to the private SSH key associated to the public key from the previous line.
* **aws_credentials**: path to the `aws-cli` credentials file. This is required to configure `aws-cli` in the instances so that they can access the S3 bucket containing the Hana installation master.
* **hana_inst_master**: path to the `S3 Bucket` containing the Hana installation master.
* **init-type**: initilization script parameter that controls what is deployed in the cluster nodes. Valid values are `all` (installs Hana and configures cluster), `skip-hana` (does not install Hana, but configures cluster) and `skip-cluster` (installs hana, but does not configure cluster). Defaults to `all`.

## Configure API access to AWS

For this terraform code to work, a pair of AWS API access key and secret key will be required, so be sure to have that.

There are several ways to configure the keys:

### Terraform provider file

Add your access key and secret key to the [provider.tf](provider.tf) file in this format:

```
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "<HERE_GOES_THE_ACCESS_KEY>"
  secret_key = "<HERE_GOES_THE_SECRET_KEY>"
}
```

Alternatively, the keys can be added in the form of terraform variables, that will be prompted by `terraform` when running the `plan` and `apply` commands or that can be passed with the option `-var aws_access_key` and `-var aws_secret_key`:

```
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "${var.aws_access_key}"
  secret_key = "${var.aws_secret_key}"
}

variable "aws_access_key" {
  type = "string"
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  type = "string"
}
```

### Environment variables

Another option is to assign environment variables with the access key, secret key, and even the default region:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<HERE_GOES_THE_ACCESS_KEY>"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<HERE_GOES_THE_SECRET_KEY>"
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-central-1"
$ terraform plan
```

### Credential file

A third option is to configure the values for the access key and the secret key in a credentials file located in `$HOME/.aws/credentials`. The syntax of the file is:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <HERE_GOES_THE_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <HERE_GOES_THE_SECRET_KEY>
region = eu-central-1
```

This file is also used by the `aws` command line tool, so it can be created with the command: `aws configure`.

**Note**: All tests so far with this configuration have been done with only the keys stored in the credential files, and the region being passed as a variable.

## Relevant Details

There are some fixed values used throughout the terraform configuration:

- The private IP address of the iSCSI server is set to 10.0.0.254.
- The cluster nodes are created with private IPs starting with 10.0.1.0 and on. The instance running with 10.0.1.0 is used initially as the master node of the cluster, ie, the node where `ha-cluster-init` is run.
- The iSCSI server has a second disk volume that is being explicitly configured as the `/dev/xvdd` block device.
- The [init-iscsi.tpl](init-iscsi.tpl) script is partitioning this device in 10 1MB partitions, from `xvdd1` to `xvdd10` and then configuring this as LUNs 0 to 9 for iSCSI.
- iSCSI LUN 9 is being used in the cluster as SBD device.
- The cluster nodes have a second disk volume that is being explicitly configured as the `/dev/xvdd` block device. This second disk is used for Hana.
- The iSCSI server init script leaves a log in the file `/root/init-iscsi.log`.
- The cluster nodes init script leaves a log in the file `/root/init-nodes.log`.

## Logs

This configuration is leaving logs of the initializations scripts in the home directory of the remote `root` user in each of the instances. Connect as `ssh ec2-user@<remote_ip>`, then do a `sudo su -` and check the following files:

* **/root/init-iscsi.log**: only present in the iSCSI server. Check here the output of the commands used to set up the iSCSI target in the instance.
* **/root/init-nodes.log**: present in the cluster nodes. Check here the output of the commands to set up the watchdog, iSCSI client, HANA installation and cluster setup in each of the nodes.

## Upload image to AWS

Instead of the public OS images referenced in this configuration, the EC2 instances can also be launched using a private OS images as long as it is uploaded to AWS as a Amazon Machine Image (AMI). These images have to be in raw format.

In order to upload the raw images as an AMI, first an Amazon S3 bucket is required to store the raw image. This can be created with the following command using the aws-cli (remember to configure aws-cli access with `aws configure`):

```
aws s3 mb s3://instmasters --region eu-central-1
```

This creates an S3 bucket called `instmasters`, which will be used during the rest of this document. Verify the existing S3 buckets in the account with `aws s3 ls`.

After the bucket has been created, the next step is to copy the raw image file to the bucket; be sure to decompress it before uploading it to the S3 bucket:

```
unxz SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw.xz
aws s3 cp SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw s3://instmasters/
```

The above example is using the SLES 12-SP4 for SAP for EC2 BYOS raw image file. Substitute that with the file name of the image you wish to test.

## Create AMI

### IAM Role creation and setup

Once the raw image file is in an Amazon S3 bucket, the next step is to create an IAM role and policy to allow the import of images.

First, create a `trust-policy.json` file with the following content:

```
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com" },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
            "StringEquals":{
               "sts:Externalid": "vmimport"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Then, create a `role-policy.json` file with the following content:

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket" 
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::instmasters",
            "arn:aws:s3:::instmasters/*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
            "ec2:CopySnapshot",
            "ec2:RegisterImage",
            "ec2:Describe*"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}
```

Note that the `role-policy.json` file references the `instmasters` S3 Bucket, so change that value accordingly.

Once the files have been created, run the following commands to create the `vmimport` role and to put the role policy into it:

```
aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document file://role-policy.json 
```

Check the output of the commands for any errors.

### Import AMI

To import the raw image into an AMI, the command `aws ec2 import-image` needs to be called. This command requires a disk containers file which specifies the location of the raw image file in the S3 Bucket, as well as the description of the AMI to import.

First create a `container.json` file with the following content:

```
[
  {
     "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1",
     "Format": "raw",
     "UserBucket": {
         "S3Bucket": "instmasters",
         "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
     }
  }
]
```

Substitute the values for `Description`, `S3Bucket` and `S3Key` with the values corresponding to the image you wish to upload and the S3 Bucket where the raw file is located.

Once the file is created, import the image with the command:

```
aws ec2 import-image --description "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1" --license BYOL --disk-containers file://container.json
```

Again, substitute the description with the description text of the image you will be testing.

The output of the `aws ec2 import-image` should look like this:

```
{
    "Status": "active", 
    "LicenseType": "BYOL", 
    "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
    "Progress": "2", 
    "SnapshotDetails": [
        {
            "UserBucket": {
                "S3Bucket": "instmasters", 
                "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
            }, 
            "DiskImageSize": 0.0, 
            "Format": "RAW"
        }
    ], 
    "StatusMessage": "pending", 
    "ImportTaskId": "import-ami-0e6e37788ae2a340b"
}
```

This will say that the import process is active and that it is pending, so you will need the `aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks` command to check the progress. For example:

```
$ aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids import-ami-0e6e37788ae2a340b
{
    "ImportImageTasks": [
        {
            "Status": "active", 
            "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
            "Progress": "28", 
            "SnapshotDetails": [
                {
                    "Status": "active", 
                    "UserBucket": {
                        "S3Bucket": "instmasters", 
                        "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
                    }, 
                    "DiskImageSize": 10737418240.0, 
                    "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
                    "Format": "RAW"
                }
            ], 
            "StatusMessage": "converting", 
            "ImportTaskId": "import-ami-0e6e37788ae2a340b"
        }
    ]
}
```

Wait until the status is **completed** and search for the image id to use in the test. This image id (a string starting with `ami-`) should be added to the file [variables.tf](variables.tf) in order to be used in the terraform configuration included here.

### Import AMI via snapshot

An alternate way to convert a raw image into an AMI is to first upload a snapshot of the raw image, and then convert the snapshot into an AMI. This is helpful sometimes as it bypasses some checks performed by `aws ec2 import-image` such as kernel version checks.

First, create a `container-snapshot.json` file with the following content:

```
{
     "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1",
     "Format": "raw",
     "UserBucket": {
         "S3Bucket": "instmasters",
         "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
     }
}
```

Notice that the syntax of the `container.json` file and the `container-snapshot.json` file are mostly the same, with the exception of the opening and closing brackets on the `container.json` file.

Substitute the Description, S3Bucket and S3Key for the correct values of the image to validate. In the case of the `instmasters` bucket, the S3Key can be found with `aws s3 ls s3://instmasters`.

Once the file has been created, import the snapshot with the following command:

```
aws ec2 import-snapshot --description "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1" --disk-container file://container-snapshot.json
```

The output of this command should look like this:

```
{
    "SnapshotTaskDetail": {
        "Status": "active", 
        "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
        "Format": "RAW", 
        "DiskImageSize": 0.0, 
        "Progress": "3", 
        "UserBucket": {
            "S3Bucket": "instmasters", 
            "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
        }, 
        "StatusMessage": "pending"
    }, 
    "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
    "ImportTaskId": "import-snap-0fbbe899f2fd4bbdc"
}
```

Similar to the `import-image` command, the process stays runing in the background in AWS. You can check its progress with the command:

```
aws ec2 describe-import-snapshot-tasks --import-task-ids import-snap-0fbbe899f2fd4bbdc
```

Be sure to use the proper `ImportTaskId` value from the output of your `aws ec2 import-snapshot` command.

When the process is completed, the `describe-import-snapshot-tasks` command will output something like this:

```
{
    "ImportSnapshotTasks": [
        {
            "SnapshotTaskDetail": {
                "Status": "completed", 
                "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
                "Format": "RAW", 
                "DiskImageSize": 10737418240.0, 
                "SnapshotId": "snap-0a369f803b17037bb", 
                "UserBucket": {
                    "S3Bucket": "instmasters", 
                    "S3Key": "SLES12-SP4-SAP-EC2-HVM-BYOS.x86_64-0.9.2-Build1.1.raw"
                }
            }, 
            "Description": "SLES4SAP 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1", 
            "ImportTaskId": "import-snap-0fbbe899f2fd4bbdc"
        }
    ]
}
```

Notice the **completed** status in the above JSON output.

Also notice tne `SnapshotId` which will be used in the next step to register the AMI.

Once the snapshot is completely imported, the next step is to register an AMI with the command:

```
aws ec2 register-image --architecture x86_64 --description "SLES 12-SP4 Beta4 Build 1.1" --name sles-12-sp4-b4-b1.1 --root-device-name "/dev/sda1" --virtualization-type hvm --block-device-mappings "DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={DeleteOnTermination=true,SnapshotId=snap-0a369f803b17037bb,VolumeSize=40,VolumeType=gp2}"
```

Substitute in the above command line the description, name and snapshot id with the apropiate values for your image.

The output, should include the image id. This image id (a string starting with `ami-`) should be added to the file [variables.tf](variables.tf) in order to be used in the terraform configuration included here.

More information regarding the import of images into AWS can be found in [this Amazon document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html) or in [this blog post](https://www.wavether.com/2016/11/import-qcow2-images-into-aws).

Examples of the JSON files used in this document have been added to this repo.

## To Do

* Investigate if it is possible to upload the images directly with terraform
* The contents of the [provision](provision) subdirectory are the same between AWS and Azure configuration, so it could be usefull to also move [init-nodes.tpl](init-nodes.tpl) and [init-iscsi.tpl](init-iscsi.tpl) there as scripts as long as the same code can be used without changes in all public cloud providers. For the moment, provision points to the Azure configuration files.
* Check AWS documentation for Hana setup and add required resources. Current configuration works for build validation of new images, but lacks certain resources that are probably needed (Load Balancer, for example) for a complete setup of Hana in AWS.
* This configuration is adding a `dlm` resource to the cluster, which is not available by default in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications for public clouds prior to 12-SP4.
