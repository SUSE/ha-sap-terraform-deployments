This project is organized in folders containing the Terraform configuration files per Public or Private Cloud providers, each also containing documentation relevant to the use of the configuration files and to the cloud provider itself.

This project uses Terraform for the deployment and Saltstack for the provisioning.

**Be careful with what instance type you will use because default choice is systems certified by SAP, so cost could be expensive if you leave the default value.**
