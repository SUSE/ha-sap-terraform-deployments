# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    workspace_info: |
      Set a workspace for your terraform deployment. The workspace might be used to generate different deployments and populate the created the resources with the used workspace name.
      In this particular case, the workspace is used to generate the Azure resource group name as **rg-ha-sap-${terraform.workspace}**.
    plan_info: |
      In this step you can generate an execution plan. The execution plan shows what _terraform_ will do when you call deploy. This lets you avoid any surprises when _terraform_ deploys.
    deploy_info: |
      In this step you can apply your plan. This may take some time. The `terraform` log will display below as it is generated.
    wrapup_info: |
      Your application has been deployed, here's how to use it.
